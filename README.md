## 🙂 About me 
I am a goal-oriented and motivated Manual QA Engineer with experience as a quality controller in a medical packaging manufacturing plant. 
During my time at the factory, I developed my communication and problem-solving skills, gaining valuable insight into the intricacies of product quality assurance.
I also have a background in UX/UI design, which allows me to approach quality assurance with an eye for user experience and design aesthetics.

I have a good knowledge of testing theory, SDLC/STLC processes, and practical experience in Web/Mobile/Game manual testing using various techniques. Also, I have experience in creating test documentation, such as test strategy, test plan, test cases and checklists, bug reports, using various tools for this purpose: Jira, TestRail, Testomatio and others.
My technical knowledge extends to working with databases, SQL queries, API testing with tools such as Postman, and a basic understanding of HTML and CSS

I am a very friendly and hardworking person, I don't stand still and keep up with the times, I am constantly developing and learning new things, I am always open to cooperation at any time! 🚀
